                            One of NCSSM’s core tenets is its emphasis on research, with over a third of the entire
                            student body actively participating in some form of scientific research. The caliber and
                            diversity of this research necessitated the Broad Street Scientific, an annual publication
                            that showcases the research conducted by students at NCSSM. Now faculty, students,
                            universities, researchers, and prospective sponsors can appreciate the success of NCSSM’s
                            research program.

                        <h3>Original Research Paper:</h3>

                        <p>
                            Your original research paper should include the following components:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Abstract – In 100-200 words, write a technical synopsis of your paper that includes
                                background, methods, results, and conclusions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Introduction – Start with a broad picture of the importance and significance of your
                                chosen
                                field while explaining introductory concepts. State the problem and goals that your
                                research
                                will address. Please cite any referenced literature.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Materials &amp; Methods – Describe how you performed your work, referencing methods and
                                procedures
                                of previous research conducted. Focus on the important aspects of your methods and avoid
                                going into
                                too much detail in describing commonly used methods.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Results – Present your findings in sufficient detail so that the reader can understand
                                the results
                                that were obtained or can follow the arguments of a mathematical proof. All figures
                                should be high
                                quality (minimum 300 ppi) and captioned appropriately so that they can be independently
                                interpreted.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Discussion – Demonstrate how your results are statistically significant and address the
                                research
                                questions posed in the introduction. Interpret your results and the implications of your
                                findings with
                                respect to your field and describe their possible applications.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Conclusion – Recap briefly what was learned from your research and assess the validity
                                of your
                                conclusions. Consider what questions might still remain to be answered and put them in
                                terms of
                                future work and how your research could act as a foundation in addressing these
                                questions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                References – References should use APA format and in text citations should be numbered.
                                For example,
                                for a paper by Smith et al., cite the paper in the text with “[1]” and then in the
                                numbered
                                references page, reference 1 should be the cited paper by Smith et al.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                        </ol>
                        <h3>Literature Reviews</h3>

                        <p>
                            While referencing relevant research, recount the scientific progress of the topic under
                            consideration.
                            Model your diction after professional peer-reviewed journals in your chosen field, but do
                            not assume
                            that the reader has previous knowledge of your topic. Assume, however, that the reader is
                            reasonably
                            well-versed in your discipline.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            References should use APA format and in text citations should be numbered.
                            For example, for a paper by Smith et al., cite the paper in the text with “[1]” and then in
                            the numbered
                            references page, reference 1 should be the cited paper by Smith et al.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Scientific Essays</h3>

                        <p>
                            Start with a topic that interests you and briefly describe the background information in a
                            manner
                            understandable to those not familiar with the scientific discipline. After evaluating
                            current research,
                            take a stance on your topic by addressing any questions. For example:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is there a possible avenue of research that seems promising in the future?</li>
                            <li>Have you thought about a different way to approach the topic at hand?</li>
                            <li>What makes this topic interesting?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These guidelines were adopted from the Siemens Competition requirements (2012).</p>
